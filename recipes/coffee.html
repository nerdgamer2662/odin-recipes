    <h1>Coffee and Coke</h1>

        This is not necessarily coffee with coke. But you can't tell, can you? Sure, this is a small cup of coffee brewed and photographed by Julius Schorzman
        under CC-BY-SA 2.0, but it could be coffee with coke. This is the ultimate evil.
    </h4>

    <p>
        This is just so bad. Why would you make this? Do you hate someone that much?

        Well, not like it's my position to deny you your revenge.

    <ul>
        <li>Half a cup of coffee</li>
        <li>Half a cup of coke</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Make sure you really want to do this. Aren't there better ways, like murder?</li>
        <li>Keep the coke out for an hour before preparation. Let it warm.</li>
        <li>Brew the coffee, and make sure it is piping hot.</li>
        <li>Mix the two liquids.</li>
        <li>Beg forgiveness.</li>
        <li>Deploy.</li>
